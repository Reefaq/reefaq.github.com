# A permalink for your MIT License

I always forget to add an MIT-license.txt file to my projects, so I
wanted to link to a single resource that would always be up to date and
would always have my details online.

But why keep this to myself, there's two ways to create your *own* MIT
license page:

1. Make a request to the API (details below)
2. Fork this project and send a pull request

Now I can always include http://rem.mit-license.org in all my projects
which links `rem` (the cname) against my copyright holder name `Remy
Sharp` - all stored in the `users` directory.

## Requesting your own MIT license page

You can fork this project, send me a pull request and wait for me to
pull (which I'll do as quickly as possible) or if the user is still
available you can do it yourself from the command line:

    curl -d'{ "copyright": "Remy Sharp" }' http://rem.mit-license.org

If the `rem` user isn't taken already, then this will create the new
user file on the fly and the url will be immediately available.

You can send a full JSON file to the API, not *just* the copyright, so this works too:

    curl -d'{ "copyright": "Remy Sharp", "url": "http://remysharp.com", "email": "me@mysite.com", "format": "txt" }' http://rem.mit-license.org

If there's any problems in the automated creation, send me a pull
request and it'll go live soon after. 

Equally if you need to update the user file to include more details that
you didn't initially include (extra fields in the next section) you will
need to send a pull request on that `user.json` file via GitHub.

## The user.json file

The `users` directory contains a list of files, each representing a host
on mit-license.org. The minimum requirement for the JSON is that is
contains a `copyright` field - everything else is optional.

Available fields:

* copyright (required)
* url
* email
* format
* version
* theme

### copyright

Create a new file and give it the name of the CNAME you want (in my case
it's `rem.json`). This file contains a JSON object containing at least a
`copyright` property:

    {
      "copyright": "Remy Sharp, http://remysharp.com"
    }

Means I can now link to: http://rem.mit-license.org and it will show my
license name (note that the date will always show the current year).

### url

In addition to the `copyright` property, if you want to make a link from
the copyright text, you can include a `url` property:

    {
      "copyright": "Remy Sharp, http://remysharp.com",
      "url": "http://remysharp.com"
    }

### email

You can also include a link to your email which is displayed after the
copyright notice using the `email` property (note the `mailto:` is
automatically added):

    {
      "copyright": "Remy Sharp, http://remysharp.com",
      "url": "http://remysharp.com",
      "email": "me@mysite.com"
    }

### format

And if you want your license to appear as plain text, just add the
`format` property (currently only `txt` and `html` are supported):

    {
      "copyright": "Remy Sharp, http://remysharp.com",
      "url": "http://remysharp.com",
      "format": "txt"
    }

### License version targeting

License version targeting allows you to link your MIT license to a
specific revision in this project - therefore fixing it permanently to
a specific license text.

Though I don't expect the license text to change ever, this is just some
extra assurance for you.

Targeting requires the [sha from the license commit](https://github.com/remy/mit-license/commits/master/LICENSE.html). This can be
specified on the URL (in your permalink) or in the JSON file.

For example: http://rem.mit-license.org/a526bf7ad1 (make sure to view-source) shows an older version of the LICENSE.html file (compared to the [latest version](http://rem.mit-license.org) - the older version didn't have the new themes).

This can also be targeted in my JSON file:

    {
      "copyright": "Remy Sharp, http://remysharp.com",
      "url": "http://remysharp.com",
      "version": "a526rbf7"
    }

Note that if no version is supplied, the latest copy of the LICENSE.html
will be displayed with your information included.

### Themes

If you've got an eye for design (or like me: not): you can contribute a
theme by adding a CSS file to the `themes` directory. The default theme
is simple and clean, but you can add your own as you like.

To use a theme, add the `theme` property to your `user.json` file, for
example:

    {
      "copyright": "Remy Sharp, http://remysharp.com",
      "url": "http://remysharp.com",
      "theme": "flesch"
    }

the json file (currently none specified on `rem`)
* [http://rem.mit-license.org/license.html](http://rem.mit-license.org/license.html) HTML

## Ways to contribute

Aside from code contributions that make the project better, there are a
few other specific ways that you can contribute to this project.

Development contributions from:

* [remy](http://github.com/remy)
* [batuhanicoz](http://github.com/batuhanicoz)

### 1. Donate domain years

I host the domain with namecheap.com and yearly renewal is $9.69 per
year. If you want to contribute a year, send me a message and I'll add
the years on.

Of course I'll do my best to continue running the domain and hosting,
but this is your chance to contribute to the community project.

Domain contributions:

* [remy](http://github.com/remy) - 2011-2012
* [barberboy](http://github.com/barberboy) - 2012-2013
* [paulirish](http://github.com/paulirish) - 2013-2014
* [batuhanicoz](http://github.com/batuhanicoz) - 2014-2015
* [buritica](http://github.com/buritica) - 2015-2016
* [adamstrawson](http://github.com/adamstrawson) - 2016-2018 (2 years)
* [keithamus](http://github.com/keithamus) - 2018-2026 (8 years)
* [pmuellr](http://github.com/pmuellr) - 2026-2027
* [danielknell](http://github.com/danielknell) - 2027-2029 (2 years)
* [barberboy](http://github.com/barberboy) - 2029-2030
* [mostly-magic](http://github.com/mostly-magic) - 2030-2032

*Please note that the whois says 2021 as you can only have 10 active
registered years with ICCAN - but the domain is set to auto-renew, so
it's all good :)*

### 2. Hosting

Currently the project is hosted on my own server, and I don't expect my
server to go away any time soon, but if a lovely hosting company, like
Joyent or Media Temple or someone equally as lovely wants to step in and
contribute a simple server to host from - then we'll credit you
appropriately and you'll get lots of kudos from the web community for
being lovely.

### 3. A lick of paint

I'm a developer, I seem only capable of *grey*! If you're a designer and
want to contribute a decent lick of paint on the project that would be
super. Just create a new theme and send me a pull request.

## License

And of course:
